# Pseudo Code Solution
<!-- use regular expressions to check if the sentence already ends in punctuation. -->
<!-- This function first creates a regular expression that matches common end-of-sentence punctuation marks -->
<!-- Finally, the function capitalizes the first letter of the sentence by using the charAt() and toUpperCase() methods, and returns the modified sentence. -->
